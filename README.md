# snake-classifier--deep-learning
The essence of the project is to serve as a tool for travelers (currently only trained on snakes from India) who travel in the wild of India, in case they have encountered a snake or even been bitten by a snake, photograph the snake and know what kind it is and if it is venomous or not.
